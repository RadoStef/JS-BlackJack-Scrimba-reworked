# JS-BlackJack-Scrimba-reworked
A Blackjack game I`ve made using the scrimba course "credits: https://scrimba.com/playlist/p3py7U7"... but reworked by me, with some additional extras :)

To try my JavaScript skills, Ive added some new functionalities to the game. They are listed below:
------------------------------------------------------------------
<ul>
<li>Introduce player button;</li>
<li>The playes can Introduce himself with its real name or Nickname, and after that he will receive 200$ chip balance (not real money of course) :)</li>
<li>Some button sounds are added</li>
<li>When Blackjack, player earn "money" </li>
<li>When Out of the game, player is losing chips</li>
<li>Counter of the games played</li>
<li>Reset game button</li>
</ul>
If you want, you can play the game here => <a href="https://www.sitefocus.eu/radoslav/blackjack.html" target="_blank"> BlackJack Reworked </a>
